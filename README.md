# Personal budget

Personal budget is a website where users keep track of their expenses and incomes. This applicaction is only avaiable in spanish for now.

*Read this in other languages: [Espa√±ol](README.es.md)*

This website was developed in MERN Stack:
* MongoDB database
* NodeJS + Express backend, with a full JSON Rest API
* ReactJS frontend

## Installation

Node JS and MongoDB is required to deploy both servers (Express API REST and React development server). You have to execute "npm install" in both folders (personal-budget-back and personal-budget-back front).   
Then you can edit this configuration files:
* personal-budget-back/bin/mongodb: you have to set up a valid mongoDB connection. Default configuration is setted in mongoDB localhost. You can set a remote connection like MongoAtlas if you want in this file.
* personal-budget-back/bin/www: you can change the express application port in this file. It is setted as 4000 by default.
* personal-budget-front/src/services/apirest: if you have changed the port in previous item, you need to edit it here as well. You can change the value "simulationRequestDelay", who is 200 in default. This simulates a delay of a tranmission from a remote Rest API in localhost. You must set this value in 0 if you want to deploy this application.
